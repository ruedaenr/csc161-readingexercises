Question 1:

A short is a number that is  16 bits long. min: -32768 max:32767
An int is simply and integer which reflects the natural size of
integers. min: -2147483648 max: 2147483647
A float is a essentially a decimal with one point of
percision.Max:3.402823466e+3  min:1.175494351e-38
A double is like a float but has two points of percision.min:
1.7976931348623158e+308 max:2.2250738585072014e-308

Question 2:
Y comes out to 3.0000 because the program will not make the set equation to
be a float, it is setting y equal to the float and then evaluating the
equation. After evaluating the equation it most likely rounds down or
truncates the answer.

Question 3:

When running the code I get an error for x and y stating that the
initializer element is not constant, I think this happens because you are
attempting to add a number to a non-number element so it creates the
error. I believe i and j remain the same because their definitions were not
altered.
